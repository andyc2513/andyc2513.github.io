## My Project

When I first decided to apply for Google Summer of Code with Google DeepMind, I had to be honest with myself - I did not know much about AI. The field seemed vast and intimidating, filled with complex mathematical concepts and terminology that felt foreign to me.

### Learning Journey

To bridge this knowledge gap, I dove into learning through multiple channels:

- **Hugging Face Tutorials**: I worked through their comprehensive tutorials, which provided hands-on experience with pre-trained models and helped me understand the practical applications of AI
- **Educational Videos**: I spent countless hours watching educational content that broke down complex AI concepts into digestible explanations, mainly on Kaggle and YouTube.
- **Documentation Deep Dives**: I read through technical documentation to understand the underlying frameworks and tools


### Practical Preparation

Beyond theoretical learning, I knew I needed to demonstrate my commitment and skills through actual contributions. I prepared by actively contributing to the **generative-ai-js** (now renamed to **js-genai**). This experience was invaluable as it:

- Gave me hands-on experience with Google's AI tools and APIs
- Helped me understand the codebase structure and development workflows
- Allowed me to make meaningful contributions to open-source projects
- Demonstrated my ability to work with JavaScript in an AI context

Additionally, I developed and deployed a simple translation Spaces app using Python and the Gemma 3 4B model. This project helped me:

- Gain practical experience with Google's Gemma models
- Learn about model deployment and inference
- Understand the challenges of building user-facing AI applications
- Work with Python in an AI/ML context using HuggingFace transformers library

This preparation phase taught me that while the initial learning curve was steep, consistent effort and practical application made the difference in building confidence and competence in the field.

This post is documenting my process of planning and determining the model selection for the GSoC project: Gemma Chat Demo.

## Project Overview

As part of my Google Summer of Code 2025 project, I'm developing a comprehensive chat demo showcasing the capabilities of Google DeepMind's Gemma 3 model family. This phase focused on model selection, technical analysis, and user research to ensure optimal performance and user experience.

## Model Selection Analysis

Based on the Gemma 3 technical report, I analyzed four different model sizes to determine the most suitable deployment option. The analysis considered model size, performance benchmarks, inference efficiency, and memory requirements to balance computational cost with model quality.

### Gemma 3 Model Family Overview

| Model       | Parameters                                         | Vision Encoder | Total Size | Context Length | Key Capabilities                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gemma 3-1B  | 698M non-embedding + 302M embedding                | None           | 1B         | 32K tokens     | Basic text generation; no vision capabilities, extremely lightweight |
| Gemma 3-4B  | 3.2B non-embedding + 675M embedding + 417M vision  | SigLIP         | 4.3B       | 128K tokens    | Multimodal with good balance of performance and efficiency          |
| Gemma 3-12B | 10.8B non-embedding + 1B embedding + 417M vision   | SigLIP         | 12.2B      | 128K tokens    | Strong performance across all tasks with reasonable resource needs  |
| Gemma 3-27B | 25.6B non-embedding + 1.4B embedding + 417M vision | SigLIP         | 27.4B      | 128K tokens    | Best performance; comparable to Gemini 1.5 Pro on benchmarks        |

**Note:** The 1B model lacks vision encoding capabilities, limiting it to text-only tasks. To fully demonstrate Gemma's multimodal capabilities, I focused on the larger models.

### Performance Benchmarks

#### Coding Performance

| Model | HumanEval | MBPP  | LiveCodeBench |
| ----- | --------- | ----- | ------------- |
| 4B    | 71.3%     | 63.2% | 23.0%         |
| 12B   | 85.4%     | 73.0% | 32.0%         |
| 27B   | 87.8%     | 74.4% | 39.0%         |

#### Research Capabilities

| Model | MMLU  | MATH  | GSM8K | GPQA Diamond |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| 4B    | 58.1% | 75.6% | 89.2% | 30.8%        |
| 12B   | 71.9% | 83.8% | 94.4% | 40.9%        |
| 27B   | 76.9% | 89.0% | 95.9% | 42.4%        |

The 27B model consistently achieves the highest performance across all benchmarks, particularly excelling in mathematical reasoning and complex question-answering tasks.

### Hardware Requirements Analysis

For deployment on HuggingFace Spaces with ZeroGPU (NVIDIA H200, 70GB VRAM), here are the memory requirements:

| Model   | bf16 + KV Cache | Int4 + KV Cache |
| ------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **4B**  | 12.7 GB         | 7.3 GB          |
| **12B** | 38.9 GB         | 21.5 GB         |
| **27B** | 72.7 GB         | 32.8 GB         |

**Important:** These figures include Key-Value caching, which is essential for optimizing inference latency and enabling efficient long-context performance.

## Final Model Choice: Gemma 3-27B

After comprehensive analysis, I selected the **Gemma 3-27B model** with Key-Value caching enabled for the following reasons:

1. **Maximum Performance**: Achieves the highest scores across coding, mathematical reasoning, and research benchmarks
2. **Hardware Compatibility**: Fits within the 70GB VRAM limit of HuggingFace's H200 GPU when using Int4 quantization
3. **Multimodal Capabilities**: Full support for text and vision tasks through SigLIP integration
4. **Production Ready**: Balances maximum capability with practical deployment considerations

## User Research Insights

To ensure the demo meets real-world needs, I identified key user personas and their requirements:

### Target User Profiles

1. **Student Researchers**
   - Need literature research assistance and data analysis help
   - Require visualization of complex concepts

2. **Software Developers**
   - Seek code generation and debugging assistance
   - Want API documentation exploration capabilities

3. **Content Creators**
   - Need creative ideation and content improvement
   - Require image analysis and description features

4. **General Knowledge Seekers**
   - Want factual information and explanations
   - Need assistance with everyday tasks

### Key User Stories

- As a student researcher, I want to input research questions and receive well-referenced summaries
- As a developer, I want code debugging suggestions without switching applications
- As a content creator, I want image captions with appropriate tone and hashtags
- As a knowledge seeker, I want to ask follow-up questions naturally

## Technical Implementation Plan

The core infrastructure will include:

- **Multi-modal Input Processing**: Support for text, code, images, and documents
- **Context Memory Management**: Session-based retention for iterative conversations
- **Optimized Inference Pipeline**: Leveraging H200 GPU capabilities for real-time responses

## Next Steps

Phase Two will focus on implementing the chat interface, integrating the Gemma 3-27B model, and developing the user experience based on the research insights gathered in this phase.
